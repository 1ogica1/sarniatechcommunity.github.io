The Sarnia Tech Community's mission is to transform Sarnia into a hub of technology and innovation.

We are creating a community of professionals that attracts tech businesses, encourages entrepreneurship, 
and generates revenue streams into our city.

We plan to do this through a conference, community events, and coworking spaces.
